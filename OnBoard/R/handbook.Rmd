# Folder structure

If you want to use the procedure outside of the github folder (recommended), you should replicate the same folder tree. In figure 1 is provided an example of the structure that should be replicated. **Please ensure that all the folders displayed in figure 1 exists**.

# Access file creation and structure

## Starting a new access file

Data collected onboard are stored in access files, located in the "OnBoard/assess" subfolder. Ideally, a maximum of 20 hauls should be stored in a .accdb file.

To start a new file, copy the template version "Maschera inserimento SOLEMON_template.accdb", paste it in the same folder and rename it as "Maschera inserimento SOLEMON_YEAR_N.accdb", where YEAR is the reporting year and N is a progressive number. Example: "**Maschera inserimento SOLEMON_2024_1.accdb**" . *It does not matter if parts of the same haul are in different files, this is handled in post-processing*.

## Starting a new haul

Each access file contains a template sheet, called "cala_template". To start a new haul, copy the template sheet, paste it and rename it as "cala_x", where *x* is the haul number. Example: **cala_1**; cala_7bis. *It does not matter if parts of the same haul are in different files, this is handled in post-processing*.

### Haul sheet Structure

The structure of the sheets, in 2024, is according to Figure1. In detail:\

-   **gear**: gear code. Accepts A and D.
-   **species_name**: solemon code
-   **length_mm**: length of the individual, in millimeters
-   **weight_g**: weight of the individuals, in grams. This also host the cumulative weight for some species, refer to "deal with cumulative data" section for further details.
-   **Sex**: required only for target species, accepts F, M, I. Leave empty if sex data not required
-   **Mat**: required only for target species, just specify the stage (1, 2, etc..). Exceptions for crustaceans: refer to section "cr"
-   **id_specimen**: fill for specimens for which detailed samples (otolit, genetic etc.) were taken. It accepts numbers and letters. When filled a serial "fishID" number would be generated.
-   **length_field2**: disc length for elasmobranchs; free spot for other species
-   **length_field3**: disc width for elasmobranchs; free spot for other species
-   **number_field1**: placeholder for cumulative number and subsamples. The compilation depends on the case
-   **number_field1**: placeholder for cumulative number and subsamples. The compilation depends on the case
-   **kg_field1**: weight in kilograms, placeholder for cumulative number and subsamples. The compilation depends on the case
-   **kg_field2**: weight in kilograms, placeholder for cumulative number and subsamples. The compilation depends on the case
-   **kg_field2**: weight in kilograms, placeholder for cumulative number and subsamples. The compilation depends on the case
-   **type_subsample**: accepts values "haul", "species", "multi", "other". The compilation depends on the case.
-   **Notes**: accept notes of any kind.

### .accdb auto compilation general details

Auto compilation applies to some column of the access file. This mean that in the processing of the table, to empty cells is assigned the first available data that is found in the previous rows. When collecting data, for these column you need to specify the value just for the first observation, then you should fill the value again only when this change. These columns are:

-   **gear**
-   **species_name**
-   **sex** (only for crustaceans)

# Collecting data

## Standard procedure

Standard procedure applies when all the individuals for a given species are collected and reported

### Target species

When reporting data for target species you should use only the first 7 columns. Of these, the columns *gear* and *species_name* autocompiles according to the first record inserted. This mean that you should write in these columns only the first time you report an observation (i.e.: first record of a gear, first record of a species). The column *id_specimen* serves to store any kind of individual id (e.g.: otholits code, genetic samples).

![Figure 3: example of compilation for target species species](C:/Users/e.armelloni/OneDrive/Lezioni/Lavoro/Solemon/github/SoleMon_project/OnBoard/data/other/target.png){width="600" height="100" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

### Elasmobranchs

When reporting data for elasmobranchs you should use only the first 9 columns. Of these, the columns *gear* and *species_name* autocompiles according to the first record inserted. This mean that you should write in these columns only the first time you report an observation (i.e.: first record of a gear, first record of a species). The column *id_specimen* serves to store any kind of individual id (e.g.: otholits code, genetic samples). Refer to the Figure 4 for reporting the 3 length measures

![Figure 4: example of compilation for elasmobranchs species](C:/Users/e.armelloni/OneDrive/Lezioni/Lavoro/Solemon/github/SoleMon_project/OnBoard/data/other/elas.png){width="500" height="400" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

### Other commercial species

When reporting data for other commercial species you should use only the first 4 columns. Of these, the columns *gear* and *species_name* autocompiles according to the first record inserted. This mean that you should write in these columns only the first time you report an observation (i.e.: first record of a gear, first record of a species).

For this species category are recorded individual length and cumulative weight. The cumulative weight should be reported in the last record, as in Figure 5.

![Figure 5: example of compilation for other commercial species](C:/Users/e.armelloni/OneDrive/Lezioni/Lavoro/Solemon/github/SoleMon_project/OnBoard/data/other/other.png){width="500" height="100" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

### Shellfishes (when all the individuals are sampled)

When reporting data for shellfishes (MUREBRA, HEXATRU, OSTREDU) you should use the columns ax reported in Figure 6. Of these, the columns *gear* and *species_name* autocompiles according to the first record inserted. This mean that you should write in these columns only the first time you report an observation (i.e.: first record of a gear, first record of a species).

NB: in case of subsamples, refer to the dedicated section

![Figure 6: example of compilation for shellfishes species](C:/Users/e.armelloni/OneDrive/Lezioni/Lavoro/Solemon/github/SoleMon_project/OnBoard/data/other/shell.png){width="1200" height="50" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

## Subsamples

Subsamples are taken when the amount of individuals in a given species is too high to be processed. Considering the onboard practice used in the solemon survey there are three cases of subsamples happening. Figure 7 reports the steps that are done according to the three cases. Each case is treated differently depending on the type of species, and the data treatment is explained in the dedicated sections.

In terms of onboard procedure, the cases general refers to:

-   Case 1: ALL the individuals from a haul are collected (sorted sample), then the sorted sample is subsampled and processed
-   Case 2: an unsorted subsample is taken from the haul, then it is sorted and ALL the individuals from the sorted subsample are processed
-   Case 3: it applies for those shellfish coming in huge quantity (MUREBRA, HEXATRU). The subsampling happens in multiple steps (refer to dedicated section)

![Figure 7: type of subsamples](C:/Users/e.armelloni/OneDrive/Lezioni/Lavoro/Solemon/github/SoleMon_project/OnBoard/data/other/subsample_general.png){width="900" height="700" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

### Target species

A typical case for subsample of target species is AEQUOPE, which usually occurs in large quantities and LFD is needed. In this case only a few individuals are measured to obtain the length structure, then it is needed to estimate total number (and sometimes total weight). Individuals that are processed for length and weight can be treated as any other target species. Regarding the other information needed to raise the values, you need to create a new record for the species (and gear) to store subsample data. There are two expected cases:

#### **case 1 - Target**

ALL individuals collected from the haul (sorted sample), then a subsample is taken (sorted subsample) for individual processing. One record is dedicated to the subsample details. The total weight of the sorted sample (in kilograms) is reported in the in the *kg_field1* field. The weight of the sorted subsample is reported in the *kg_field2*. *type_subsample* is "species". The individuals subsampled are processed according to the standard procedure for target species, creating a new record for each specimen.

![Figure 8: subsamples, case 1 for target species species](C:/Users/e.armelloni/OneDrive/Lezioni/Lavoro/Solemon/github/SoleMon_project/OnBoard/data/other/target_sub1.png){width="900" height="400" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

<br> <br>

#### **case 2 - Target**

A subsample is taken from the haul (unsorted subsample), then ALL the individuals in the subsample are collected (sorted subsample) for individual processing. One record is dedicated to the subsample details. The weight of the haul is reported in *kg_field1*. The weigth of the unsorted subsample is reported in *kg_field2*. The weight of the sorted subsample is reported in *kg_field3*. *type_subsample* is "haul". The individuals subsampled are processed according to the standard procedure for target species, creating a new record for each specimen.

![Figure 9: subsamples, case 2 for target species species](C:/Users/e.armelloni/OneDrive/Lezioni/Lavoro/Solemon/github/SoleMon_project/OnBoard/data/other/target_sub2.png){width="900" height="400" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

<br> <br>

### Non-target species (MUREBRA, HEXATRU, etc..)

A typical case for subsample of non-target species is MUREBRA. When it occurrs in large aggregations, total number (and sometimes total weight) are estimated from subsamples. To store information needed to raise the values, there are two expected cases:

<br>

#### **Case 1 - Non target**

ALL individuals collected from the haul (sorted sample), then a subsample is taken (sorted subsample) for estimating total number. One record is dedicated to the subsample details. The total weight of the sorted sample (in kilograms) is reported in the in the *kg_field1* field. The weight of the sorted subsample is reported in the *kg_field2*. The number of individual in the sorted subsample is reported in the *number_field1*. *type_subsample* is "species".

![Figure 10: subsamples, case 1 for non target species species](C:/Users/e.armelloni/OneDrive/Lezioni/Lavoro/Solemon/github/SoleMon_project/OnBoard/data/other/nontarget_sub1.png){width="900" height="400" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

<br> <br>

#### **Case 2 - Non target**

A subsample is taken from the haul (unsorted subsample), then ALL the individuals in the subsample are collected (sorted subsample) for estimating total number. One record is dedicated to the subsample details. The weight of the haul is reported in *kg_field1*. The weigth of the unsorted subsample is reported in *kg_field2*. The weight of the sorted subsample is reported in *kg_field3*. The number of individual in the sorted subsample is reported in the *number_field1*. *type_subsample* is "haul".

![Figure 11: subsamples, case 2 for non target species species](C:/Users/e.armelloni/OneDrive/Lezioni/Lavoro/Solemon/github/SoleMon_project/OnBoard/data/other/nontarget_sub2.png){width="900" height="400" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

<br> <br>

#### **Case 3 - Non target**

it has been only used for MUREBRA and HEXATRU in cases of exceptional catches. ALL individuals of these two species are collected from the haul (partially sorted sample), then a subsample is taken from the partially sorted sample (partially sorted subsample). The partially sorted subsample is sorted, aka it is divede into species (sorted subsample). The sorted subsample of each species is subsampled againg (sorted sub subsample) for estimating total number. One record is dedicated to the subsample details. The weight of the partially sorted sample is reported in *kg_field1*. The weigth of the sorted subsample for each species is reported in *kg_field2*. The weight of the sorted sub-subsample is reported in *kg_field3*. The number of individual in the sorted sub-subsample is reported in the *number_field1*. *type_subsample* is "multi".

![Figure 12: subsamples, case 3 for non target species species](C:/Users/e.armelloni/OneDrive/Lezioni/Lavoro/Solemon/github/SoleMon_project/OnBoard/data/other/nontarget_sub3.png){width="900" height="400" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto"}

# Processing data

Data are processed in R. The code runs on R 4.0.5 32 bit version due to compatibility issue with RODBC package needed to read from .accdb. It is good practice to process the data relatively frequently in order to create backup files and to produce some checks that can be used to adjust data.

## process haul data

Data stored in the .accdb file are retrieved and handled by R scripts, located in the "R" folder. The required script is `workflow_access_v0`.

### process single hauls

To process single hauls, run the lines up to 15 and then please set the following parameters:

-   **haul**: number of the haul corresponding to the name given in the access file, but without the extension ''. Example: 'cala22' in access is '22' here, 'cala45bis' is '45bis'
-   **db**: suffix given to the acces file. E.g.: if access file name is *'Maschera inserimento SOLEMON_test.accdb'*, type just *'test'* here.
-   **updateID**: this control if update ('Y') or not ('N') the serial number 'fishID'. Recommended to type 'Y' only when batch processing all the hauls.
-   **area_sepia**: old command
-   **year**: year of the survey
-   **area**: stratum of the haul

```         
# set parameters
haul=22 
db='test'
updateID='N'
area_sepia='D'
year=2022
area='ITA17'
```

\

When parameters are set, the data processing is pre-defined: you just have to run it without changing the parameters. The first step is the `function1`, which scope is to format the access table according to output standards. There is no need to see the output of this function. Just run it.

```         
# function1 extract data from access db and format them
hauldata=function1(haul=haul, 
                   db=db,
                   year=year)# extract and format data
```

\

When the function1 is done, you can proceed with the `function2`, which scope is to perform some checks. Checks done are plots that would be saved under the path 'output/checks'

```         
# function 2: perform checks
function2(xdat=hauldata, 
          haul=haul)
```

\

`function3` scope is to format data according to trust format. Excel sheets are saved under the path 'output/trust'.

```         
# function 3: format data to trust format
trustdat=function3(xdat=hauldata[[1]], 
                  haul=haul, 
                  year = year, 
                  weight_not_target = hauldata[[2]],  
                  subsamples_target=hauldata[[3]],
                  catch_sample_disattivati = catch_sample_disattivati) # function 2
                  
                  
```

\

`function4` creates a pdf report and save it under the path 'output/pdf'.

```         
# function4: save PDF
function4(trustdat = trustdat, 
          year=year,
          area = area,
          haul=haul)
```

### loop to process more hauls

To process more than one haul, you should care to properly fill in the 'haul_order' excel sheet (see input data section). After having loaded the haul summary, just run the loop represented below.

```         
haul_summary=read_excel("data/haul_order.xlsx")
haul_summary=haul_summary[1:5,]

for(xhaul in 1:nrow(haul_summary)){
  
  
  # loop parameters
  haul=haul_summary[xhaul,]$haul
  db=haul_summary[xhaul,]$DB
  area=haul_summary[xhaul,]$country
  
  cat('processing haul no.', haul, '(', xhaul,'/', nrow(haul_summary),')' )
  
  # function1 extract data from access db and format them
  hauldata=function1(haul=haul, 
                     db=db,
                     year=year)# extract and format data
  
  # function 2: perform checks
  function2(xdat=hauldata, 
            haul=haul)
  
  # function 3: format data to trust format
  trustdat=function3(xdat=hauldata[[1]], 
                     haul=haul, 
                     year = year, 
                     weight_not_target = hauldata[[2]],  
                     subsamples_target=hauldata[[3]],
                     catch_sample_disattivati = catch_sample_disattivati) # function 2
  
  # function4: save PDF
  function4(trustdat = trustdat, 
            year=year,
            area=area,
            haul=haul)


}
```

```

\
\

### fishID

Store the *updated* serial number used to identify specimens for which detailed samples (otolit, genetic etc.) were taken. This number should refere to the *last* ID assigned to a specimen. The use of this file is controlled by the `updateID` parameter in the workflow_access_v0 file: if `updateID` is set equal to Y, the fishID file is used to assign IDs (when requested) and it is then updated. The columns refers to:

-   **type**: not useful (to be removed)
-   **code**: this is the alphanumeric part of the code to be assigned to specimens
-   **fishID**: serial number referring to the *last* individual contained in the past records
-   **haul**: not useful (to be removed)
-   **species**: indicates which species belong to the code category. If need to add species, use : as separator and do not insert spaces.

```

\
\

### lw_pars

Store the length-weigth parameters of target species. This file is used to reconstruct length (or weight) when it is not available in the recorded data. Example: shrimps where missi a part of the tail but have the head intact are suitable only for length measurement; fishes that were spoiled by the gear may be ok for weight but not measurables for length. The columns refers to:

-   **species_name**: indicates which species belong to the code category (solemon code)
